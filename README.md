# Welcome to THE LYRICS WORLD!

Hi, I'm Dahyeon. I built this website as my final project for Concordia web dev bootcamps.

Here is my basic idea behind this website...

Have you ever wanted to understang the meaning of your favorite foreign language song's lyrics? For me, yes. I liked the melody of the song but I didn't understand the lyrics because it's not my first language.

I thought it would be great if those who know more than two languages add the lyrics translated in other languages. Then we can enjoy a lot of songs more because we finally get the meaning of lyrics!
The users can search for a song by its title or artist. They can see the translated lyrics if somebody added it.

This website is waiting for users' help :)
